A state diagram shows the behavior of classes in response to external stimuli. Specifically a state diagram describes the behavior of a single object in response to a series of events in a system. Sometimes it's also known as a Harel state chart or a state machine diagram. This UML diagram models the dynamic flow of control from state to state of a particular object within a system.
